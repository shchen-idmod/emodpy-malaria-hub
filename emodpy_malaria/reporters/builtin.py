            'gametocyte_detection_threshold'. The Default is False.
        parasite_detection_threshold: Used when 'add_true_density' is true.  The true parasite density

            These channels will use 'Detection_Threshold_True_HRP2' to determine if person's HRP2 level counts towards prevalence.
        hrp2_detection_threshold: Used when 'add_hrp2_prevalence' is true.  If the true HRP2 value is greater than this threshold,
            the prevalence will be increased in the 'PfPR_2to10-HRP2' and the 'PfPR by Age Bin-HRP2' channels.
        age_bins: The max age in years per bin, listed in ascending order. Use a large value for the last bin,
            to collect all remaining individuals
        infectiousness_bins: infectiousness Bins to aggregate within for the report
        max_number_reports: the maximum number of report output files that will be produced for a given simulation
        parasitemia_bins: Parasitemia bins on which to aggregate. A value <= 0 in the first bin indicates that
            uninfected individuals are added to this bin. You must sort your input data from low to high.
        pretty_format: if True(1) sets pretty JSON formatting, which includes carriage returns, line feeds, and spaces
            for easier readability. The default, 0 (false), saves space where everything is on one line.

    will have data for the people in that node.
